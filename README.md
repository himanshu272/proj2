# proj2
#this is just a short project based on the task given in hack.me
#this script sends the code ther person has made to the codechef online judge

#it accepts the unique ID of the problem and the complete location of the answer file that the user has created
    for example: the unique code of the problem www.codechef.com/problems/START01 is START01
                  and the location of the problem is /home/himanshu/testupload.cpp
